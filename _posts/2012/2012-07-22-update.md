Life hasn't left much time for updating this blog.  I submitted [seatmate](http://seatmate.iknuth.com) to the trimet app contest and won [second place](http://howweroll.trimet.org/2012/03/21/announcing-the-tour-pdx-app-contest-winners/).  I am very grateful to trimet and I appreciated the opportunity to participate.

In March I became the senior front end developer for [Ecotrust](http://ecotrust.org).  I've been working on a variety of projects including the launch of an open source spatial planning and geodesign framework called [madrona](http://madrona.ecotrust.org).  I'll be spending more time on UI and rolling out an html/js mobile app.  I'll be continuing to work on javascript applications with a renewed focus on mapping

The new job has been great and I get to work with a fascinating group of developers, gis specialists, writers and economists.
